# to double-check that Git is installed

# To configure Git, you must define some global variables: user.name and user.email. Both are required for you to make commits.
# set name in Cloud Shell
git config --global user.name "<USER_NAME>"
# create user.email configuration variable
git config --global user.email "<USER_EMAIL>"

# Git works by checking for changes to files within a certain folder
# create an empty folder (aka the project directory)
mkdir Cats
# change to the project directory
cd Cats
# initialize a Git repository into the folder
# set the name of the default branch to main

# common commands
git status      # display the state of the working tree and of the staging area
git add         # start keeping track of the changes in certain files -> staging the changes (prepare for a commit)
git commit      # put a copy in the repository as a new version

GitHub
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-github/2-what-is-github
# GitHub provides an AI-powered developer platform to build, scale, and deliver secure software
# GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git, a distributed version control system, at its core. 
# The GitHub platform simplifies the process of collaborating on projects 
# and provides a website, command-line tools, and overall flow that allows developers and users to work together.

branch
Branches are an essential part of the GitHub experience. They let you make changes without affecting the default branch.
Your branch is a safe place to experiment with new features or fixes. 
If you make a mistake, you can revert your changes or push more changes to fix the mistake. 
Your changes won't update on the default branch until you merge your branch.

pull request
A pull request is the mechanism used to signal that the commits from one branch are ready to be merged into another branch.
